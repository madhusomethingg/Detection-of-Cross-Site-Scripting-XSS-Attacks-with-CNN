# Detection-of-Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-Attacks-with-CNN

This project involved the utilization of XSS Scripts for feature generation, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques were employed to classify and detect the presence of XSS scripts as either malicious or benign. To achieve this, various neural network algorithms and models were implemented.
